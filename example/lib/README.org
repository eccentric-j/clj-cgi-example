#+title: Lib Directory

* What is this directory?

This is the recommended directory to store libs among your multiple Clojure
projects on a shared server.

You should add your .jar files and static pods here.

See [[../][the base README for general info]]
See [[../build-pods/][the build-pods dir for info on building static pods]]

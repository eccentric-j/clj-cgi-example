#+title: Bin Directory

* What is it?

Typically this would be in your home folder and can hold binaries. It's
recommended to upload the babashka binary and add the dir to your
PATH your =~/.bash_profile= for your login shell. This allows you to type `bb
./test.clj` instead of having to specify the full path to the binary.

Example in =~/.bash_profile=:

#+begin_src bash
PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"

export PATH
#+end_src

Make sure you give the Babashka static binary exec permissions like ~chmod +x ~/bin/bb~.
